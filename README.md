# DataStructure

This repository is in use to learn and apply TDD. 
To learn in pratice without a guide how the tests will guide the construction of functionalities and how it will guide the refacts when it's needed.
And to do it i will try to add new things and change older dependencys only to need to refactor code. To fail tests and make them successful again.
As a side objective improve Data Structures concepts.
